# Security Policy

`agenda-skill` is a skill of the Cerase platform: instructions an assistant follows when it reads the person's calendar and lists the day's or the week's appointments, offering to prepare a meeting or to send the capture to a call. It runs no code of its own; a defect here is an instruction that could lead an assistant to book, join or record something the person did not choose, or to list an appointment that is not there.

It is maintained by Guidance Studio S.r.l.

## Supported versions

The release unit is the `main` branch. Cerase ships the same `SKILL.md` in its
appliance image and in the Cerase Marketplace. A fix ships as a new commit on
`main` and a new image; no earlier line is patched.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email **tech@guidance.studio** with `agenda-skill` in the subject. That
mailbox reaches the maintainers.

Do not open an issue, a discussion or a pull request for a suspected
vulnerability. This repository is public, so any of those is a disclosure.

Include as much of this as you have:

- what the defect is, and which instruction it is in
- the commit you tested
- steps to reproduce, or the conversation that shows it
- what an attacker gains, and what access they need to begin

Reports in English or Italian are equally welcome.

## Disclosure

Please hold details until a fixed image is published. We will tell you when
that happens, and we will credit you unless you prefer otherwise.

There is no paid bug bounty.
